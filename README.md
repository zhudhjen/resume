# Resume

Jonathan Zhu's resume in Markdown.

Online Version: [http://pitayazhu.me/resume](http://pitayazhu.me/resume)

Thanks for Zeno Zeng for [his resume template](https://github.com/zenozeng/resume).

## Build

```bash
sudo apt-get install wkhtmltopdf
npm install
./build.sh
```

## Future Plan

The project is forked by too many people and becomes hard to implement new functions. The CSS is badly styled and the html is heavily injected by the script, which makes it hard to customize. I'm currently planning to write a new resume page on my own.
